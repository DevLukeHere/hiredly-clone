              Here are some basic guidelines to optimise your job search
              experience:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Upload an accurate, truthful and professional resume.</h3>
            <span>
              Your resume is your golden ticket to land your dream job. It is
              also your chance to make a good first impression on prospective
              hiring managers. Please ensure that you have included complete and
              accurate information on your resume, and that none of it is
              misleading or out of date. Here are some basic things you should
              have in your resume:
              <br></br>
              <ul>
                <li>Your name</li>
                <li>E-mail address</li>
                <li>Current location (Eg. Petaling Jaya, Malaysia)</li>
                <li>Contact number</li>
                <li>Educational background</li>
                <li>Working experience (if any)</li>
                <li>Special skills</li>
                <li>Past achievements and activities</li>
              </ul>
              If you need some guidance on how to make a good resume,&nbsp;
              <a href="https://my.hiredly.com/advice/perfect-resume-checklist">
                here are our tips and tricks to help impress your future boss
              </a>
              .
            </span>

            <h3>2. Complete your profile.</h3>
            <span>
              It&apos;s important to fill up your profile honestly and
              completely. In addition to your resume, employers will also be
              able to see your profile, as this is the standard practice with
              all job platforms. Your profile serves as a summary that employers
              can easily look through before diving into your resume.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              It&apos;s also highly recommended that you record a video cover
              letter on your profile as well. This video cover letter is sent
              along with your application to the employers, so take the
              opportunity to stand out and share your personality.
              <br></br>
              DO:
              <br></br>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Use a proper name for your account. Employers will see the
                  name you chose that is displayed alongside your resume.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Write a simple but informative summary about you. Tell
                  employers who you are and what kind of opportunities you are
                  looking for.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Record a quick 30-second video cover letter that is
                  professional and informative.
                </li>
              </ul>
              DO NOT:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Provide any false, misleading or inappropriate information.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </span>

            <h3>3. Pick a professional profile picture.</h3>
            <span>
              It is optional to have a profile picture on Hiredly. If you do
              upload one, you should aim to look professional and presentable.
              <br></br>
              <ul>
                <li>Ensure that your photo is clear.</li>
                <li>Only use a picture of yourself.</li>
                <li>Make sure that your face can be clearly seen.</li>
                <li>Keep it professional.</li>
              </ul>
            </span>

            <h3>4. Communicate in English.</h3>
            <p>
              Hiredly uses English as its main language across its platforms to
              ensure clear communication between all parties. The use of other
              languages is accepted and welcomed, however all written
              information must also be presented in English alongside the chosen
              language.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              For example, if you want to upload your resume in another
              language, you must at least ensure that you&apos;ve presented all the
              same information in English too — in the same document with page 1
              is in English and page 2 is all the same information in Bahasa
              Melayu.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Apply for jobs responsibly.</h3>
            <p>
              Using the filters available, we encourage you to apply to jobs
              that are relevant and of interest to you. Do not send applications
              to jobs that you are not seriously interested in. Read the job
              description before sending your application.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              When applying for a job, you will have 30 minutes to cancel your
              application if you change your mind. After 30 minutes, job
              applications can no longer be cancelled or deleted.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Do your best to attend any interviews that have been set and
              communicate respectfully with employers.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Take note of your messages.</h3>
            <p>
              With our built-in chat system, it&apos;s easier than ever for
              employers to contact you. Keep a lookout as employers may use the
              chat system to conduct virtual interviews, ask for more
              information or to schedule an interview with you. Remember to be
              courteous and take all messages seriously.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Do note that employers may also contact you through your email and
              contact number provided in your resume and Hiredly profile.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Respect copyright.</h3>
            <p>
              Only use and upload documents that you have made or have been
              authorised to use. This includes any information, resumes&apos;,
              pictures, projects, etc. Copyrighted material will be removed
              immediately upon request of the rightful owner.
            </p>

              to hire junior to mid-level talent. Our platform includes a job
              portal and headhunting service, which you can use separately or
              synergistically together as a hybrid solution.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              The guidelines below will help you to optimise your hiring
              solutions as well as create a safe job searching experience for
              all:
            </p>

            <h3>
              1. Create an insightful, transparent and genuine Company Profile.
            </h3>
            <span>
              Your company profile gives candidates an insight into what it’s
              like working for your company by allowing them to have a closer
              look at your people, culture and work environment.
              <br></br>
              DO:
              <br></br>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Provide as much information as you can. Fill up the ‘About Us’
                  and ‘Culture’ write up. Transparency gives candidates a sense
                  of confidence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Provide complete and accurate information such as in respect
                  of your nature of business, address, website, benefits, etc.
                </li>
                <li>Be honest about your company’s vision and mission.</li>
                <li>Use updated photos of your company’s workspace.</li>
              </ul>
              DO NOT:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Be dishonest about your office culture. Every company is
                  different and if you are looking for the right candidate that
                  matches your company, the key is to be accurate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use fake or copyrighted photos that do not belong to you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Use your company profile as a platform to sell any of your
                  products or services. Hiredly is strictly a job advertisement
                  platform only.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </span>

            <h3>2. Put up informative, accurate and frank job postings.</h3>
            <p>
              Job descriptions should be simple but concise, these help
              candidates understand the job and requirements easily. We highly
              encourage employers to fill up as much information as they can
              accurately such as job type, experience level, salary, job
              preference, etc. This will also help serious candidates easily
              narrow down their search to the most relevant jobs.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Communicate in English.</h3>
            <p>
              Hiredly uses English as its main language across its platforms to
              ensure clear communication between all parties. The use of other
              languages is accepted and welcomed, however all written
              information must also be presented in English alongside the chosen
              language. For example, a job description written in Malay must be
              accompanied by a version written in English.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Equal Opportunity Policy.</h3>
            <p>
              Hiredly believes that one of the foundations of a great company
              begins with equal access to employment opportunities for all
              individuals, irrespective of race, colour, gender or other
              criteria that appear to favour discrimination. All candidates
              should be treated equally and respectfully.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              It is important to build teams that allow individuals to realise
              their full potential based on their aptitudes and merits, not
              their identity. As such, we have guidelines for all content
              featured on our platform, which are detailed within our&nbsp;
              <Link href="/">Terms & Conditions</Link>. We
              treat any breach of our policies or procedures seriously and will
              remove any content that does not comply with these guidelines.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Hiredly strongly values the unique spirit of diversity and unity
              in Malaysia, believing that our differences should not be
              evaluated as part of employment decisions.
            </p>
